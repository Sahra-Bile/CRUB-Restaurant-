## working process

This project was pretty difficult at times. To push through we had a good working partnership and lots of laughs. We prioritate authencity and when we found some things more diffucult and like they would never work out; we supported, listened and communicated without judgement.

We also have very different styles and taste when it comes to the visual interface. But with respect for each other and stepping back when someone elses idea seems to work better, we are truly very happy with the finished product. And also very happy this is over.

Jokes aside, this was a good project to practice working with react on a deeper level and also learning more about CRUD operations.

Thank you for reading this far and hope you find some charm in this project.
